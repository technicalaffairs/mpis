in industry and the home. The word &quot;solvent&quot; is generally defined as
liquid used to dissolve other substances, a definition that includes water as a
solvent.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left" dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The most common solvents fall into five categories these are:</font></p>
<ol dir="ltr">
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:4" dir="ltr" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohols.</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">

    and CFCs.</font></li>
</ol>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Other less commonly used groups of organic solvents are glycol

</blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Danger of solvents</font></p>
</b>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left" dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8">
<span dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Most solvents are hazardous; some are flammable, others
explode easily, some are corrosive, and most are toxic. In generally, the
solvents that contain halogens ( chlorin, fluorine, bromine, and iodine ) are
less apt to catch fire, explode, or corrode tanks and pipelines than
nonhalogenaed originc solvents. The most commonly used halogentaed solvents are
the chlorinated ones. Unfortuantely, chlorinated solvents in 1987 was 1.5
billion pounds. Only 1% reused or recycled, whereas about 94% is eventually
released into the environment, mostly into the air. The rest is incorporated into
various products such as polyviny1 chloride, plastic, CFCs, and plastic food
wrap.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p ALIGN="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Nearly all of the demand for chlorinated is filled by only
four chemicals:</font></p>
<ol dir="ltr">
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Methylene chloride</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Trichloroethane</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Trichloroethylene</font></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tetrachloroethylene</font></li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This four chemicals are either used directly, or they are
further processed to yield specialized solvents, plastics, and pharmaceuticals.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Demand for chlorinated solvent is dropping due to increased
recycling technological changes, and substitution with less toxic water
solvents. Nevertheles, chlorinated solvents will continue to be used in large
quantities for years to come. These solvents are used during the manufacture of
a huge variety of everyday products, and it takes time to find less toxic
substitute chemicals and integrate them into industrial processes.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Chlorinated solvents are also used by a myriad of small and
medium - sized businesses, which are often difficult to incorporate into
recycling programs. Finally, chlorinated solvents are relatively inexpensive for
industries to buy, and many of the costs associated with cleaning up
contamination by chlorinated solvents is not borne directly by the users of the
chemicals. Thus, industries have no economic incentive for finding ways to
reduce the use of these solvents.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Human Health and Environmental Effects</font></p>
</b>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Human health effects due to exposure to solvents can include
damage to the skin, liver, blood, central nervous system, and some times the
lunge and kidneys. Some solvents are iritants, while others are capable of
causing cancer. Since solvents generally evaporate easily at room temperature,
most solvent exposure results from breathing vapors. But leaks in underground
storage tanks, surface impoundment, and accidental spills have exposed
significant numbers of people to solvents via groundwater.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Solvents can also be absorbed into the body upon skin
contact, although this is a minor exposure route for most people. Solvents
spilled on the skin strip skin cells of vial oils and fats, causing red,
cracked, or scaly skiing. Once exposure stops, the skin usually heals itself.
Some solvents are allergens and cause allergic dermatitis among sensitive
people, even if they do not actually touch the solvent.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Inhaling, solvent vapors, even short periods, can lead to
lung and throat irritation pulmonary edema, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred
vision, nervousness, sleepiness or insomnia, nausea, vomiting, disorientation,
contusion, irregular heartbeat, and even unconsciousness and death. Many of
these symptoms pass quickly when exposed stops.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some symptoms of acute exposure cannot befell immediately.
Certain chlorinated solvents, for instance, cause delayed lung, liver, and
kidney damage. Chemicals that do not cause an immediate display of symptoms of
overexposure and said to have good warning ability because dangerous
concentrations cannot be detected by overexposed people.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Repeated exposure to some solvents can lead to chronic
bronchitis, permanent liver and kidney damage, and permanent liver and kidney
damage ,and permanent neurological problems. Solvents can affect the body’
sabiliy to manufacture blood, while some can amage the immune system. Many
commonly encountered chlorinated solvents including benzene, trichloroethlene,
tetrchloroethlene, and methlene chloride, are suspected of causing cancer. Some
solvents cause, or are suspected of causing birth defects. For example, glycol
ethers have recently been founded to cause birth defect and reproductive
problems among test animals. Most solvents really pass form material to teal
blood, thus exposing unborn children to potentially toxic compounds.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">People concerned about solvent exposure should learn the
composition, scientific names, toxicity, and degree of hazard associated with
all solvents they use. Material Safety Data Sheet ( MSDS) containing this
information should be readily available to people exposed to solvent at the
workplace. Unfortunately, the precise chemical composition of proprietary
solvent mixtures may not be available, and the toxicity information presented on
the MSDS may be incomplete or confusing. Should this be the case , contact your
local department of health or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
( OSHA ).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Consumers may have a difficult time finding information about
the toxic hazards associated with architectural coatings ( house paint ), art
and craft materials, and cleaning supplies can be difficult. Consumers product
labels are not presently required to list specific solvent ingredients. The so-
called inert ingredients are solvents that are subject to lax regulation.
California’s right- to – know regulation is an attempt to inform consumers
about the presence of chemicals in products that cause cancer or birth defects.
But the law’s effectiveness has not been demonstrated because not all consumer
products are labeled clearly. Also, cancer and birth defects are a small subset
of the potential problems associated with solvents in consumer products. A
report issued by the California state Department of Health Services states that
over 60 different solvents are commonly used in consumer products. The most
common solvents found in consumer products are ethanol, isopropyl alcohol,
kerosene, propylene glycol, isobutane, butane, and propane, none of which are
highly toxic or are known to cause cancer or birth defects, but about 250 tons
perday of these materials are released into California’s air every year.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Effect of Solvent on Environment</font></p>
</b>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some of these commonly released solvents cause serious
environmental problems when released into urban air. Many volatile solvents
contribute to the formation of urban ozone, while other, including CFCs
trichoroethethane, and carbon tetrachloride to stratospheric ozone depletion.
Chlorinated solvents are often persistent in soil and water, leading to the
environmental problems as socieated with bioconcentration and ground water
pollution. Sometimes solvents released into the environment mix with other
chemicals or degrade to form more toxic products. For example, trichloroethane
degrades in soil to form the toxic chemical vinyl chloride.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Until products are clearly labeled , allowing people to make
informed chices, consumers are urged to buy water – besed products whenever
they are available and effective. When water based products are not available
learn the names of the solvents used in various product formulations and try to
choose the ones that the least toxic to people or the environment.</font></p>
